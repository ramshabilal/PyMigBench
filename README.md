# PyMigBench
Library migration is the process of replacing one library with another in a client project.
_PyMigBench_ is a benchmark of Python Library Migration that we developed in the paper:
> Mohayeminul Islam, Ajay Kumar Jha, Sarah Nadi.
> PyMigBench and PyMigTax: A Benchmark and Taxonomy for Python Library Migration.
> _arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.01124. 2022 July 3_.

Other than the benchmark, we also developed _PyMigTax_,
a taxonomy of the migration related code changes that we include in PyMigBench.
Please read the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01124) to learn more about PyMigBench and PyMigTax.

This repository contains the benchmark data and the tools to explore the data. Please visit our [website](https://ualberta-smr.github.io/PyMigBench) to learn more about the dataset and the tool.
