# PyMigBench contributing guide
Thank you very much for your interest in PyMigBench.
Please follow this document to find the best way you can contribute.

## Submit new migration data
We will be happy to include manually validated Python library migration data in PyMigBench.
Please [submit a data request](https://github.com/ualberta-smr/PyMigBench/issues/new?template=data-request.md) and attach your dataset to the issue.
We currently support two types of data: library pairs and migrations.
The data should be in YAML format as described in our [dataset page](https://ualberta-smr.github.io/PyMigBench/dataset).
Please leave the IDs blank as we will assign them.

We will review your data and add it to the benchmark, or contact you if there are any issues. 

## Request a new query
[Submit a query request](https://github.com/ualberta-smr/PyMigBench/issues/new?template=query-request.md) if you need a query that is not currently supported by the tool.
