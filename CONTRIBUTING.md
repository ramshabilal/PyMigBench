# PyMigBench contributing guide
Thank you very much for your interest in PyMigBench.
Please follow this document to find the best way you can contribute.

## Submit new migration data
We will be happy to include manually validated Python library migration data in PyMigBench.
Please [submit a data request](https://github.com/ualberta-smr/PyMigBench/issues/new?template=data-request.md) and attach your dataset to the issue.
We currently support three types of data: library pairs, migrations and code changes.
You can submit only library pairs or library pairs and migrations or all three types of data.
The data should be in YAML format as described in our [dataset page](https://ualberta-smr.github.io/PyMigBench/dataset).
Alternatively, you can submit one CSV file per dataset, where each row represents one item.
The header should be same as the properties in the YAML files.
Please leave the IDs blank.

We will review your data and add it to the benchmark, or contact you if there are any issues. 

## Request a new query
[Submit a query request](https://github.com/ualberta-smr/PyMigBench/issues/new?template=query-request.md) if you need a query that is not currently supported by the tool.
