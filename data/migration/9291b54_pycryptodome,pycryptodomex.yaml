commit_message: 'Suggest change to pycryptodomex vs pycryptodome Crypto hooks


  In preparation for pyinstaller or similar compilation tools as it would

  be beneficial to migrate to the more explicit Cryptodome namespace due

  to a notable lack of support for pycryptodome hooks in pyinstaller.'
