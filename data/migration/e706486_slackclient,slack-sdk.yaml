commit_message: 'updates the implementation of the slack backend for notifications


  Use the slack_sdk instead of the deprecated slackclient. Because according to the
  official documentation:

  >  The slackclient PyPI project is in maintenance mode now and slack-sdk project
  is the successor.

  With this commit one UPGRADE BLOCKER from requirements/requirements.in is removed.
  Als the license for slack_sdk

  is updated and unit tests for slack notifications backend are added.
